- ⚡ Fun fact: The first programmer in history was a woman:
Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician, is considered the first programmer in history. In the 1840s, she wrote an algorithm intended to be processed by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, a general-purpose mechanical computer. Her pioneering work laid the groundwork for modern programming.
This fact highlights that programming is a field that has been shaped by contributions from diverse people throughout history. And that this field is open to everyone.

I hope this is helpful and motivating.
